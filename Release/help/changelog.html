<div class="Title">Version 0.5 (2004-08-21)</div>
The timing mode is now more complete thanks to the contribution of Kaiousama
who added SubStationAlpha like time selection and also mouse wheel key modifier.
<br>
<br>
Here is a more complete list of changes :
<ul>
	<li>Added new mouse buttons handling in timing mode (left/right button set start/stop time,
	like in SubStationAlpha, can be disabled in Preferences)</i>
	<li>Added mouse wheel key modifiers (Configurable, default is :
	Wheel = Horizontal zoom, Shit+Wheel = Vertical zoom, Ctrl+Wheel = Time scrolling)</li>
  <li>Added "Replace subtitle from pipe" function (usefull in case of pre-timing)</li>
  <li>Added backup and auto-backup functions (create .bak files in VisualSubSync\Backup directory)</li>
  <li>Added option to detach video window</li>
  <li>Added auto-correction of subtitles collision on load when current subtitle stop equal next subtitle start</li>
  <li>Fixed problem with pipe character "|" in subtitles, we now don't convert to text with pipe internally, just when we display in VirtualTreeView</li>
  <li>Fixed new line handling in middle of a subtitle</li>
  <li>Fixed WAVDisplay refresh bug when double clicking title bar</li>  
</ul>

<br>

<div class="Title">Version 0.4 (2004-07-15)</div>
In this version appear the new "Text pipe"© feature. It's used to synchronize
subtitles from an already made transcript. You load your transcript in the text
pipe, you select a sentence in the WAV display part, you select the matching 
text in the text pipe and you choose "Add subtitle from pipe". You have the
option to automatically delete the text you added from the pipe, it's why
it's called a pipe, text his moving out as you add subtitles.
<br>
<br>

<ul>
	<li>Added new keyboard shortcuts to shift start/stop time by 10/100 ms</li>
	<li>Added vertical zoom option</li>
	<li>Added "Text pipe"© with new <a href="tutorial2.html">tutorial</a></li>
	<li>Changed the way shortcut are now written to config files</li>
	<li>Changed the way subtitles from a text file are inserted, now time is incremented for each sub to avoid sorting problems</li>
	<li>Fixed problem when subtitle start time = stop time (division by 0)</li>		
	<li>Fixed problem when changing subtitle filename in project dialog to a new empty file, old subtitles were not cleared</li>
	<li>Fixed problem when subtitle start time is > stop time, time are now swapped automatically</li>
	<li>Fixed miscalculation in peak file normalization</li>
</ul>

<br>
