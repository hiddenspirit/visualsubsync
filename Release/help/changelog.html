<div class="Title">Version 0.9.11 (2007-10-28)</div>
Version 0.9.10 was supposed to be the last one before 1.0 but any modern application should have Undo/Redo functionality

</ul>
Big thanks to the people of <a href="http://www.sub-way.fr">sub-way.fr</a> and
specially to NathBot for making some great JavaScript <a href="http://nathbot.free.fr/vss/">plug-ins</a> (some are now included into VSS and some more probably later).
<br>
<br>

<div class="Title">Version 0.9.10 (2007-03-04)</div>
A quick bug fix release because we have a major bug here:<br>
<ul>
	<li>Fix loading of SRT files : The last line in file was not read
correctly and replaced by a blank line if there was no empty line at end of file.</li>
</ul>
Thanks again to Sixe for the bug report.
<br>
<br>

<div class="Title">Version 0.9.9 (2007-02-24)</div>
This is a kind of release contest version before 1.0, so don't forget to report any bugs, thanks.<br/>
There is two big improvements in this version: the subtitles video preview and the SSA/ASS style editor.<br>
With SSA/ASS support getting more complete, it's important to know that you can directly create your project
in SSA/ASS format by setting the extension accordingly in the project creation window.<br>
There is also improvements in the timing mode with the space bar, now you can time an existing
transcript and VSS will try to ensure a characters per seconds target, a minimal subtitle
duration and a minimal blank duration between subtitles.<br>
Also good to remember, if you experience a crash, don't forget to check the backup directories (<i>Preferences... &gt; General &gt; Backup</i>)<br>
Here is a more complete changelog :
<ul>
	<li>Improved subtitles video preview by using a custom VSFilter version.
		Saving subtitles is not needed anymore to have an updated preview. If playing is stopped
		you will need to play the subtitle again to update the preview.	If you pause the video, you can see modifications in real time.</li> 
  <li>Added SSA/ASS style editor</li>
  <li>Added new configurable shortcuts to set subtitle start/stop time during "live timing" :
  	<i>Set subtitle start time</i>, <i>Set subtitle stop time</i>, <i>Set subtitle stop time / go to next</i></li>
  <li>Improved timing mode with space bar, there is now a set of options to modify existing
    subtitles instead of creating new one.</li>
  <li>Added pause button</li>
  <li>Added volume trackbar</li>
  <li>Added configurable shortcut to toggle between normal and timing mode : <i>Toggle between normal and timing mode</i></li>
  <li>Application settings are now saved in user application data directory if in read only mode</li>
  <li>Improved screen font size handling</li>
  <li>Detached video window state is now saved per project</li>
  <li>Added support for reading UTF-16 Unicode files</li>
  <li>Added configurable shortcut ("next error") to go to next error.</li>
  <li>Added a "general" JavaScript plugin with 2 functions (OnSubtitleModification and OnSubtitleSelection).
    It is currently used to show statistics (can be disabled by deleting
    jsplugin\general\general_plugin.js)</li>
</ul>
Thanks to Guilamu, Sixe, Thyresias and Stef for suggestions and testing.

Fix the new mouse anti-overlapping feature.
<br>
<br>

<div class="Title">Version 0.9.1 (2005-10-15)</div>
This is mainly a bug fix release. Though there is one new feature, when
making selection or modifying existing subtitles in the wav displayer, the
mouse position is constrained in some way to avoid subtitles overlapping. If
you don't like this behaviour you can disable it in the preferences (last
checkbox in "General" tab).
<br>
Bug fix and small changes list:
<ul>
	<li>Added optionnal mouse anti-overlapping feature</li>
	<li>The "Find" shortcut (F3) is now configurable</li>

  <li>Fix for small "false" selection (<80ms)</li>

<br>

<div class="Title">Version 0.8 (2005-04-08)</div>
The big new thing in this release is of course the experimental karaoke support.
To create a karaoke, you first synchronize the lyrics as normal subtitles.
Then you separate each syllable by "/" and you right click in the subtitle list and
choose "Create karaoke". You can now adjust each syllable in the waveform part.
By double clicking on a karaoke syllable, you select that syllable, and you
have access to common VSS function like shift start/stop time, play and
next but at the syllable level.<br>
You work in the .srt file format, when you have finished, you can export the final
version of the file to ssa by using the new "Export to SSA..." function.<br>
Using karaoke in a .srt file is not valid even if vobsub/vsfilter play it.
<br>
<br>
Here is a more complete list of changes:
<ul>
	<li>Experimental karaoke support</li>
  <li>Added "Show frame at cursor", "Show stop frame" and "Show start frame" hotkeys</li>
  <li>Export to SSA</li>
  <li>Export to WAV + html</li>
  <li>Show a little message in status bar when we receive a suggestion</li>
  <li>Fixed 8 bits wav loading</li>
</ul>

<br>

<div class="Title">Version 0.7 (2005-01-09)</div>
In this release, I've added some live subtitling functions. Now, when you're
playing your video file, you have keys to create subtitles. For example,
in timing mode, when you press the space key, VSS store the current playing time and
when you release it, it creates the subtitle, so you can do a quick timing with only one key.
If you want a bit more flexibility, in the HotKeys settings, you also have 3 new hotkeys :<br>
- "Start new subtitle"<br>
- "Stop current subtitle"<br>
- "Stop current sub and start new sub"
<br>
<br>
Here is a more complete list of changes:
<ul>
  <li>Added live subtitling function</li>
  <li>Improved dynamic subtitle selection (more visual feedback, now works when you are before or after a subtitle)</li>
  <li>Added "Clear selected" suggestion context menu (on Aspirantnemo request)</li>
  <li>Added "Auto save when playing start" option in backup settings (on Mr kb request)</li>
  <li>Added a warning for some bad wav file</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in srt loading with empty lines</li>
  <li>Fixed playing of .vob/mpeg2 files again</li>  
</ul>

<br>

<div class="Title">Version 0.6 (2004-12-24)</div>
The new toy in this version is the support for JavaScript plugins. By making
little scripts you can add your own error detection/correction functions.
Old ones have been converted to plugins with some improvements, for example
the "too long line" function now include a "smart" line splitter. There is
also a plugin to check french typography. Of course you can send me any plugin
you have made.<br>
For easier plugins developpement, you can download the JavaScript 1.5 Reference
<a href="http://visualsubsync.corecodec.org/CoreReferenceJS15.zip">&gt;&gt; here &lt;&lt;</a><br>
A big thanks to the nice guys of the <a href="http://delphi.mozdev.org/">Delphi JavaScript Bridge</a> project.
<br>
<br>

<br>

<div class="Title">Version 0.5 (2004-08-21)</div>

who added SubStationAlpha like time selection and also mouse wheel key modifier.
<br>

  <li>Added option to detach video window</li>
  <li>Added auto-correction of subtitles collision on load when current subtitle stop equal next subtitle start</li>

<br>

<div class="Title">Version 0.4 (2004-07-15)</div>
In this version appear the new "Text pipe"© feature. It's used to synchronize
subtitles from an already made transcript. You load your transcript in the text
pipe, you select a sentence in the WAV display part, you select the matching 
text in the text pipe and you choose "Add subtitle from pipe". You have the
option to automatically delete the text you added from the pipe, it's why
it's called a pipe, text his moving out as you add subtitles.

</ul>

<br>

Normal and Timing. You can change the mode quickly using the button in the
