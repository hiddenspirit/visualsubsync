<div class="Title">Version 0.91 (2005-10-15)</div>
This is mainly a bug fix release. Though there is one new feature, when
making selection or modifying existing subtitles in the wav displayer, the
mouse position is constrained in some way to avoid subtitles overlapping. If
you don't like this behaviour you can disable it in the preferences (last
checkbox in "General" tab).
<br>
Bug fix and small changes list:
<ul>
	<li>Added optionnal mouse anti-overlapping feature</li>
	<li>The "Find" shortcut (F3) is now configurable</li>
  <li>Fix shifting of karaoke second syllable start time.</li>
  <li>Fix for small "false" selection (<80ms)</li>
  <li>Fix some typo (Ok -&gt) OK</li>
  <li>Fix Undo/Redo in subtitle text edition field</li>
  <li>Fix bug in audio extraction (especially for MPEG files)</li>
</ul>
Thanks to Mr. kb for his bug report :-)

<div class="Title">Version 0.8 (2005-04-08)</div>
The big new thing in this release is of course the experimental karaoke support.
To create a karaoke, you first synchronize the lyrics as normal subtitles.
Then you separate each syllable by "/" and you right click in the subtitle list and
choose "Create karaoke". You can now adjust each syllable in the waveform part.
By double clicking on a karaoke syllable, you select that syllable, and you
have access to common VSS function like shift start/stop time, play and
next but at the syllable level.<br>
You work in the .srt file format, when you have finished, you can export the final
version of the file to ssa by using the new "Export to SSA..." function.<br>
Using karaoke in a .srt file is not valid even if vobsub/vsfilter play it.
<br>
<br>
Here is a more complete list of changes:
<ul>
	<li>Experimental karaoke support</li>
  <li>Added "Show frame at cursor", "Show stop frame" and "Show start frame" hotkeys</li>
  <li>Export to SSA</li>
  <li>Export to WAV + html</li>
  <li>Show a little message in status bar when we receive a suggestion</li>
  <li>Fixed 8 bits wav loading</li>
</ul>

<br>

<div class="Title">Version 0.7 (2005-01-09)</div>
In this release, I've added some live subtitling functions. Now, when you're
playing your video file, you have keys to create subtitles. For example,
in timing mode, when you press the space key, VSS store the current playing time and
when you release it, it creates the subtitle, so you can do a quick timing with only one key.
If you want a bit more flexibility, in the HotKeys settings, you also have 3 new hotkeys :<br>
- "Start new subtitle"<br>
- "Stop current subtitle"<br>
- "Stop current sub and start new sub"
<br>
<br>
Here is a more complete list of changes:
<ul>
  <li>Added live subtitling function</li>
  <li>Improved dynamic subtitle selection (more visual feedback, now works when you are before or after a subtitle)</li>
  <li>Added "Clear selected" suggestion context menu (on Aspirantnemo request)</li>
  <li>Added "Auto save when playing start" option in backup settings (on Mr kb request)</li>
  <li>Added a warning for some bad wav file</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in srt loading with empty lines</li>
  <li>Fixed playing of .vob/mpeg2 files again</li>  
</ul>

<br>

<div class="Title">Version 0.6 (2004-12-24)</div>
The new toy in this version is the support for JavaScript plugins. By making
little scripts you can add your own error detection/correction functions.
Old ones have been converted to plugins with some improvements, for example
the "too long line" function now include a "smart" line splitter. There is
also a plugin to check french typography. Of course you can send me any plugin
you have made.<br>
For easier plugins developpement, you can download the JavaScript 1.5 Reference
<a href="http://visualsubsync.corecodec.org/CoreReferenceJS15.zip">&gt;&gt; here &lt;&lt;</a><br>
A big thanks to the nice guys of the <a href="http://delphi.mozdev.org/">Delphi JavaScript Bridge</a> project.

In this version appear the new "Text pipe"© feature. It's used to synchronize
subtitles from an already made transcript. You load your transcript in the text
pipe, you select a sentence in the WAV display part, you select the matching 
text in the text pipe and you choose "Add subtitle from pipe". You have the
option to automatically delete the text you added from the pipe, it's why
it's called a pipe, text his moving out as you add subtitles.
